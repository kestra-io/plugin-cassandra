description: "Tasks that run CQL queries or polling triggers against self-managed Apache Cassandra clusters."
body: "Use these tasks to execute queries or fire triggers with a Cassandra session built from contact endpoints, optional local datacenter, credentials, and SSL truststore/keystore details. Supports fetch/fetchOne/store output options so downstream steps can consume result rows while reusing the same connection schema across query and trigger tasks."
